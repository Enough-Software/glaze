h1. Welcome to Glaze



Glaze is a UI framework for BlackBerry Java Applications.



Glaze uses CSS to style native fields: well-known CSS properties like margin, background-color and width as well as advanced properties for backgrounds, borders and fonts can be used to change the style and layout of an application to any design you wish. 



*Benefits*

* Create stunning and resolution-independent designs

* Easy and lightweight integration and development

* Seperate the design from the development of buisness logic

* Use sandboxing to rapidly create an application design on multiple devices at the same time
