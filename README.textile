h1. Welcome to Glaze

Glaze is a UI framework for BlackBerry Java Applications.

Glaze uses CSS to style native fields: well-known CSS properties like margin, background-color and width as well as advanced properties for backgrounds, borders and fonts can be used to change the style and layout of an application to any design you wish. 

*Benefits*
* Create stunning and resolution-independent designs
* Easy and lightweight integration and development
* Seperate the design from the development of buisness logic
* Use sandboxing to rapidly create an application design on multiple devices at the same time
