Glaze is a UI framework for BlackBerry Java Applications.

*Benefits*
* Create stunning and resolution-independent designs
* Easy and lightweight integration and development
* Seperate the design from the development of buisness logic
* Use sandboxing to rapidly create an application design on multiple devices at the same time
